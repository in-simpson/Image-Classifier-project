# Developing an AI Application

Going forward, AI algorithms will be incorporated into more and more everyday applications. For example, you might want to include an image classifier in a smartphone app. To do this, you'd use a deep learning model trained on hundreds of thousands of images as part of the overall application architecture. A large part of software development in the future will be using these types of models as common parts of applications.

## Project Description

In this project, you'll train an image classifier to recognize different species of flowers. You can imagine using something like this in a phone app that tells you the name of the flower your camera is looking at. In practice, you'd train this classifier, then export it for use in your application. We'll be using this dataset of 102 flower categories.
## Project Structure

Here's an overview of the project's structure:

- `data/`: Contains the dataset of 102 flower categories.
- `train.py`: File for training the image classifier.
- `predict.py`: File for testing the trained classifier.
- `Image Classifier Project.ipynb`: Jupyter Notebook for training and testing the image classifier.
- `app/`: Folder for the smartphone app development (if applicable).

## Getting Started

Before you start working on this project, ensure you have the necessary tools and libraries installed, such as:

- Python
- Deep learning frameworks (e.g., TensorFlow, PyTorch)
- Jupyter Notebook

## Usage

You can follow the Jupyter Notebooks (`train.py`, `predict.py` and `Image Classifier Project.ipynb`) to train and export the image classifier. If you plan to integrate this classifier into a smartphone app, make sure to adapt it according to your application's requirements.
